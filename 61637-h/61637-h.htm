  <h2 class='c005'>Winter Russell<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Russell: Ladies and gentlemen.
I am very glad to have the opportunity
of speaking to you this afternoon,
and I may say at the outset
that it is obvious that my adversary
and I agree upon one thing, and that
is that we are discussing what is absolutely
the most vital question before
the American people today. (Applause.)
We are absolutely in accord
on that, and we are just as far opposed
in our method of approach as
it is possibly probable to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>I want to say at the outset that we
are going to deal—or I am, and I assume
my adversary is, too—with
ideals and principles and not with
persons. I want you to realize that I
consider myself speaking—and I
trust reverently—on the most important
subject that I have ever advocated.</p>

<p class='c007'>I heard one of the greatest psychologists
this country has ever produced
who said “When you conceive
of the mere handful of people that inhabit
all the globe, and you think of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the vast river of humanity that is
flowing on this planet, and you think
of the billions of unborn, you wonder
if man sometimes transcends the
impossible and thinks and considers
the unborn as God himself,” and I believe
today I am speaking in behalf
of the great unborn—those who
are being murdered by the thousands,
if not millions, in a manner that far
transcends the method of our warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, I said that we are going to
speak of ideals and principles and
not of persons. It is very difficult
oftentimes not to attack a person or
hurt his feelings when you characterize
the principle of an act, and you
sometimes have to be assailing a
person. I hope and I try to love every
human being on the face of the earth.
There are principles and ideals I abominate
and abhor with every drop
of blood and feeling that I have. I
never want that abhorrence of the
principle or ideal of the person to adhere
to that person.</p>

<p class='c007'>I heard a minister the other day
speaking of the French and Germans
who were having some conferences,
and he was asked “did they still hate
one another?” and he said they did
not hate one another because they
broke bread together and you could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>not hate a person with whom you
have broken bread, and he could not
hate anybody that he knew.</p>

<p class='c007'>I hate and abominate the principles
that I am fighting, but I trust
that you will take the sting, fumigate
it, take the anti-toxin, if you
will, because I don’t want any allusions
to personality to be taken from
any of the statements that I make.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another thing I want to say about
my opponent, and I hope she will say
the same about me, is that I want to
bow in sincere respect and admiration
for what I conceive to be her
utter and absolute sincerity, and to
her devotion to the cause which she
advocates. I question that in no
degree. I hope she will give me the
same consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are going to deal with these
principles. I am not going to concern
myself much with authorities. I
suppose she can quote from Dr. Robinson
and apparently Dr. Knopf (he
says he isn’t an authority,) and others
as authorities. I could quote from
Lamb and Roosevelt and the Bible—the
great religions of the earth—scriptural
authority that comes from
the very depths of the spiritual, and
what I believe to be the very mouth
of God itself—of Nature—if you do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>not like to admit the existence of
Providence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am not concerned with Scripture
or authorities. I am going to deal
with this question with what I believe
are the cold, inevitable facts
of life as we know them, and meet
them every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I am going to admit in the
first place that there are many families
with too many children. It
would be foolish to gainsay that.
They are a burden to the mother.
They are a hardship to the father
who tries to provide for them. They
make conditions unfair and unjust
for the other children. The question
is, and I hope that she will admit it
also, that there are thousands of
homes in the United States of America
that are too lacking in children—although
I think she has once stated
that the most immoral thing a person
can do is to bring a large family
into the world—so we have
thought, for example—and the
question is, how are we going to
meet it?</p>

<p class='c007'>I propose that we should meet
this problem by the measure of
self-control. I believe by that
means that we can solve the problem
thusly, and at the same time
we gain one of the greatest advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>that you can possibly win
on the face of the earth. Sex control
is the best path to self-control
and to self-discipline. It is the
key to wisdom. It is the key to
power. It is the key to intellectual
and mental development; indeed,
she has once stated that only
those people who are mentally developed
are capable of self-control
and I want to say that they got a
large measure of their mental development
by self-control. She is
looking through the wrong end of
the telescope.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so we come to this method.
I want as another part of my platform
upon which I am to stand to
say that I conceive and hold marriage
to be more than physical.
It is not a purely sensual relationship.
It borders on the aesthetic,
spiritual, mental, and modern aspects
of life, and when you try to
take the physical by itself you
find a condition of naked sensuality,
which is disastrous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c007'>My contentions are these: In
the first place, fundamentally, virtually,
universally, infinitely from
every point of view; it is vicious,
it is false from every scientific construction
that you can possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>conceive of; it is one of the most
vitiating things that you can conceive
of from every point of philosophy,
and physiology  and psychology—in
 other words that you
take the law of compensation and
try to solve it. It is false from
every point of view—from the
practical point of view.</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe it is disastrous intellectually,
mentally, and spiritually.
It is disastrous and perpetrates
a great wrong upon the unborn millions
who are waiting for
entrance upon this great amphitheatre
of life. It is disastrous
physically, mentally, and spiritually
upon the future. It is disastrous
to the same degree upon the
people who practice it—husbands and
wives who resort to these measures
and then I hold that it perpetrates
the greatest crime of all the ages,
namely, race suicide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me approach the first method,
and that is this question of whether
it is right from the point of view of
the philosophy of man, if you will,
and I want you to consider it simply
from the practical living point of
view. I want to lay down this proposition—it
is that you can’t have
pleasure in this world without paying
for it—that there are certain laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that sweep through the entire universe
from the furtherest star to the
tiniest atom and molecule that you
can find in existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am a member of the bar of the
State of New York. I trust that I
have due regard and respect for the
statutes, the constitution and the laws
of this great city, state and nation.
But I hold them as the veriest trash
when they come up against the laws
of Nature. The laws of Nature cannot
be revised. They cannot be repealed.
There is no power in this
whole universe that can change these
laws and you have to deal with that.</p>

<p class='c007'>That means you can’t get pleasure
without paying for it. Nature is inexorable
in bringing about her retribution.
It does not need any balance
book. You can never embezzle. You
can’t cheat. You can’t get away from
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emerson has said that “the ingenuity
of man has always been dedicated
to the solution of one problem—how
to detach the sensual sweet, the
sensual strong, the sensual bright
from the moral sweet, the moral deep,
the moral fair—that is again to contrive
to cut clean off this upper surface
so thin as to leave it bottomless
to get a one end without an other end.
The soul says eat, the body would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>feast. The soul says, ‘The man and
woman shall be one flesh and one
soul.’ The body would join the flesh
only.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All things are double, one
against another,” continued Emerson.
“Tit for tat. An eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth, blood for blood,
measure for measure, love for love.
Give it and it shall be given you. He
that watereth shall be watered
himself. What will you have, quoth
God, pay for it and take it. Nothing
ventured, nothing have. Thou shalt
be paid exactly for what thou hast
done, no more, no less. Who doth not
work, doth not eat. Harm watch,
harm catch. Curses always recoil on
the head of him who imprecates them.
If you chain a slave, one end chains
you. Bad counsel confounds the adviser.
The devil is an ass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>You must pay at last your own debt.
Those are the laws. Now we recognize
it in physics. Energy cannot be annihilated.
Birth control says “yes” you
shall pay the price. You can annihilate
that energy and drink from
the cup of pleasure, but you don’t
take the responsibility—the duty and
the care. You recognize it in physics.
You recognize it in chemistry, in
every law of life. When Ponzi in
Boston said, “I will give you 50
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>percent”—the world laughed because
it can’t be done. Birth control advocates
like the Ponzis say they will
give you 50 percent and 100 percent
on your investment, but it can’t be
done. It is frenzied finance. It is
along the lines of the people who are
alchemists, who think they can turn
the baser metals into gold. It is an
age-long dream. It is a belief that
has been held from the beginning of
time. That thing cannot be done.
That is the law of life—of God—that
you have to pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so that is the thing you are
confronted with. I don’t say that
you don’t seem to gain, but for every
gain you seem to grasp you have
lost the life of it. He who does not
work shall not eat. The trouble is
that we are bound by the fetish of
money, of gold, and lose sight. In
other words we have eyes literally
that see not, and ears that hear not.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that is the thing that we must
consider. So I want you to have in
mind, that by the very law of life,
the very theory of science of our being,
we have to pay, and if we take
that, if we try to grasp that we are
going to pay the penalty. In my next
opportunity to address you I shall
take up that to show you how we pay.
(Applause.)</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Margaret Sanger<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Sanger: Mr. Chairman, and
ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Russell
and I seem to agree on some of the
points of this argument at least, but
as usual with most opponents of birth
control, they have absolutely no intelligent
argument. (Laughter.)
They always barricade themselves behind
the Bible or the terrible vengeance
of an offended nature. That is
exactly what Mr. Russell is doing
now.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, friends, I want to say let us
get down to fundamental principles.
Let us get together and look at
life the way it is now, not as it might
have been had Nature acted thus and
so, not as it might be had God done
thus and so, but as we find ourselves
today. We have a few principles of
life by which we must live, and I
claim that every one of us has a right
to health, to liberty and to the pursuit
of happiness. I say furthermore that
birth control is an absolutely essential
factor in our living and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>those three principles of happiness.
(Applause.)</p>

<p class='c007'>By birth control, I mean a voluntary,
conscious control of the birth
rate by means that prevent conception—scientific
means that prevent
conception. I don’t mean birth control
by abstinence or by continence or
anything except the thing that agrees
with most of us, and as we will develop
later on, most of us are glad
that there are means of science at
the present time that there are not
injurious, not harmful, and all conception
can be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now let us look upon life as it really
is, and we see society today is divided
distinctly into two groups: those
who use the means of birth control
and those who do not.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the one side we find those who
do use means in controlling birth.
What have they? They are the people
who bring to birth few children.
They are the people who have all the
happiness, who have wealth and the
leisure for culture and mental and
spiritual development. They are people
who rear their children to manhood
and womanhood and who fill the
universities and the colleges with
their progeny. Nature has seemed to
be very kind to that group of people.
(Laughter.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>On the other hand we have the
group who have large families and
have for generations perpetuated
large families, and I know from my
work among these people that the
great percentage of these people that
are brought into the world in poverty
and misery have been unwanted. I
know that most of these people are
just as desirous to have means to
control birth as the women of wealth.
I know she tries desperately to obtain
the information, not for selfish purposes,
but for her own benefit and for
that of her children. In this group,
what do we have? We have poverty,
misery, disease, overcrowding,
congestion, child labor, infant mortality,
maternal mortality, all the
evils which today are grouped in the
crowd where there are large families
of unwanted and undesired
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the first one and let us see
how these mothers feel. I claim
that a woman, whether she is rich or
poor, has a right to be a mother or
not when she feels herself fit to be
so. She has just as much right not to
be a mother as she has to be a mother.
It is just as right and as moral
for people to talk of small families
and to demand them as to want
large families. It is just as moral.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>If we let, as we are supposed to do,
nature take her course, we will
say that we know that any woman
from the age of puberty until
the age of the period of menopause
that that woman could have anywhere
from 15 to 20 children in
her lifetime, and it will only take
one relationship between man and
woman to give her one a year to
give her that large family. Let us
not forget that.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are we today, as women who wish
to develop, who wish to advance in
life, are we willing to spend all of
our time through those years of development
in bringing forth children
that the world does not appreciate?
Certainly, anyone who looks
out to that will find that there is
very little place in the world for
children. And besides, if a woman
does spend all her time in child-bearing,
do you know that even with a
healthy woman, that if she does this
one out of ten of those women who
have children as often as Nature
sends them, dies from child-bearing?
One out of every ten of women
who let nature take her course and
have from 12 to 16 children die from
child-bearing, and furthermore,
there are many cases where it is
absolutely indispensable for a woman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>health, for her life in fact, to
have means to control birth. There
are cases as Dr. Knopf said, of syphilis,
cases of tuberculosis; do you
realize that out of every seven women
who have tuberculosis today that
four of them die, not from tuberculosis,
my friends, but they die from
pregnancy. They die because they
have not that knowledge of birth
control, because physicians and all
the others who should be disseminating
information and safeguarding
these women’s lives are not giving
them the fundamental things to cure
her disease, but they allow her to
become pregnant. They keep her in
ignorance from this particular
knowledge that should assist her in
recovering her health. Not only
with tuberculosis, but there are
other diseases that are inimical
to the woman’s health and happiness.
Heart disease is another
thing that pregnancy absolutely
stimulates and it means a woman’s
death. Not long ago there was a
young girl who came to me who had
kidney disease. She was a telegraph
operator. Her husband was a
young working man, but he was not
able to support a family. She had
on two different occasions tried to
have children, but she had kidney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>disease and they found her in convulsions,
she had froth at her mouth
and she was taken to a hospital in
a serious and critical condition.
When she did this, the only thing
they could do to her was to resort
to abortion and yet they send her
back to her home, to her husband
and family again in just the same
way with no information of how to
protect herself against another condition
just as she had gone through.
That is what happens to our women
today, even those who are suffering
from disease where they should be
protected with means and knowledge
of birth control.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only weapon that women
have and the most uncivilized weapon
that they have to use if they
will not submit to having children
every year and a half, the weapon
they use is abortion. We know how
detrimental abortion is to the physical
side as well as to the psychic
side of woman’s life, and yet there
are in this nation, because of these
generalities and opinions that are
here before us, that are stopping
the tide of progress, we have more
than one million women with abortions
performed on them each year.</p>

<p class='c007'>What does this mean? It means
it is a very bad sign if women indulge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in it, and it means they are
absolutely determined that they cannot
continue bringing children into
the world that they cannot clothe,
feed and shelter. It is a woman’s instinct,
and she knows herself when
she should and should not give birth
to children and it is just as natural
to trust this instinct and to let her be
the one to say and much more natural
than it is to leave it to some
unknown God for her to judge her
by. I claim it is a woman’s duty
and right to have for herself the right
to say when she shall and shall not
have children.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that the death rate, maternal
death rate, has not been falling
in the United States of America, although
the death rate from diseases
has been falling. That shows woman
is given the last consideration in
scientific and medical lines. But
then woman will never get her own
freedom until she fights for it, and
she has to fight hard to hold and
keep it. We know too that when
the children that come to this mother
against her will and against her
desires, when they come into the
world, that we have an appalling
number of 300,000 babies each year
in this country who die each year
before they reach one year of age—300,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>if you please, and it is safe
to say and anyone who has gone
among these mothers and these children—it
is safe to say that the great
percentage of these children that
are born have been unwanted. The
mother knows that that child should
not come to birth, when the five
or six or seven that she has have
not enough to eat. That takes common
sense and every working woman
has that common sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have these 300,000 babies, this
procession of little coffins, and we
shake our heads sadly and say something
must be done to reduce the
number, but nevertheless we go right
on allowing 600,000 parents to remain
in ignorance of how to prevent
300,000 more babies coming to
birth the next year only to die
from poverty and sickness.</p>

<p class='c007'>We speak of the rights of the unborn.
I say that it is time to speak
of those who are already born.
I also say and know that the
infant death rate is affected tremendously
by those who arrive last.
The first child that comes—the first
or second or third children who arrive
in a family, have a far better
chance than those who arrive later.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that out of a thousand
children born that 200 of them live [sic<a id='t19'></a>]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>when they are either the second or
third. When the seventh arrives
there are 300 that die out of that
thousand, and by the time that the
twelfth child arrives, 600 of this
thousand passed away, and so we
can see that the man or woman who
brings to birth two or three children
has a far better chance of
bringing them to maturity than if
they continued to have nine or ten
or twelve children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those are facts. They are not
generalities or opinions. The United
States Government stands behind
these facts. Then we also, through
our maternity centers and child welfare
means and other means, we
finally rescue some of these children,
and do not allow them to die under
one year of age, and then when the
mother is pregnant again—if maternity
was not forced upon her—she
would be able to bring that child
through. Another one begins to
come, and we find that this child
that was rescued from dying during
its first year now succumbs before
its fifth year, and then we have
150,000 children who die before they
reach the fifth year of age and so
we can enumerate all of these conditions
which are so despicable and
so difficult in this country because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>we will not get to fundamentals. We
will not deal with the cause of
things while we are anxious to deal
with the cure. When a mother does
finally bring her children through
the adolescent period, what is the
next thing she has for that? We
find in the South that where children
come according to Nature, every
year and one-half, that as soon
as they are able, they are shuffled
and hustled on in to take the place
and compete with their father in the
factories. That is the place that
society has for children of the poor.
We find in other states, too, where
it is only a question of a few years
later that also the children as soon
as they are able to take their place
in industry, are pushed out of home,
not because the mothers of these
children are not just as anxious to
see them in universities and colleges
but because of the pitiless earnings
that she must have to support those
who are coming behind them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of us know this. We know
something about the actual conditions
of life as it is among us. In
some of the factories of Lowell and
Fall River, Mass., it was found that
of the children who work and toil
there, under ten years of age, that
85 percent of them come from families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of eight—their mothers have
given birth to eight children—and
we find in the south very much the
same thing, excepting a higher percentage
of 90 to 93 percent of the
children there.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is not the only thing. We
have conditions again that are more
disastrous to the race than child
labor or infant mortality, and that
is the transmission of the venereal diseases
to the race that is to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that the mothers and fathers
of today produce the race of tomorrow,
and know that unless
we have a clean child
and a clean stream of blood
pouring through that child that
the race of tomorrow is a doomed
foregone conclusion. We know,
too, that out of this terrible
scourge of disease that we
have 90 percent of the insanity in
this country, due to syphilis. Anyone
who is dealing with fundamentals
would know that these people
should use means to protect themselves
against having children. They
should absolutely in due regard to
themselves, to their children and to
the race, not allow a child to be
born while that disease is running
riot in the system, and then we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>that terrible consequence which is
insanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have fifty percent of the still
births of this country, in other
words, dead babies, that are dead
when they are born—50 percent are
due to this disease. You may think
that these things are taken care of,
but if I told you that they are not—syphilitic
women today are allowed
to bring forth progeny even in the
face of all officialdom, and all the
kind and humane things and other
kind of things that are doled out to
women today—that women are
bringing forth children when they
themselves are syphilitic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long ago we took a syphilitic
woman to 43 hospitals in the city
and every one of them said, “We will
cure her disease. Leave her here.
We will do the best we can for her,
but don’t ask us to give her the information
to control birth. That is
not our office. That is not for us,”
and so that little syphilitic woman
went back again to her home and
will become pregnant only to abort
again, which was a great kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature sometimes brings the syphilitic
to birth before their full
time, or brings them dead. In other
states of syphilis, that is not so, and
we have feeble-minded as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>as insane. We have 400,000 feeble-minded
people in the United States
that any authority on the subject
would say to you “Not one of them
should have been born.” They never
should have been born and sometimes
these parents are perfectly
normal, and yet this taint has gone
through the blood and has left this
perfectly normal physical person
who arrives at the adult age with
all its physical functions, and yet it
has the mentality of a child eight
years of age. The feeble-minded
man or woman is of no use to itself
or society, and it would be better if
we were living in a real civilization
that they should not have been born.
Only 40,000 of this 400,000 are entered
in institutions and the others
are living among us, producing and
reproducing their progeny and providing
abundant material and opportunity
for the continuance of
charities and other institutions for
ages and generations more to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found also in one institution—a
so-called reformatory where
they take the girls of the underworld—prostitutes—in
Geneva, Ill.,
they find that 50 percent of these
girls coming into the underworld—the
prostitutes—was of this cause,
that she belonged to the feeble-minded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and again we find that 89
percent of these came from large
families.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can’t get away from it, my
friend. Large families and poverty
and misery go hand in hand. Now
what do we try to do for all these conditions?
How do we look out upon
them? We are in a track. Motherhood
has been tracked. We find
that most of the social agencies of
the country are trying to legislate
these things out of existence. That
is all. They run off to Albany and
to Washington and they make eight-hour
laws for women in industry,
but they never think of the poor
mother in the home who might
have eight hours. Can you think
of the mother in the home with eight
hours? She has to go out of the
home, out into industry to be protected
by the law. Do you realize
that mothers and women never have
a night’s rest from the time that
they are pregnant, some of them
until the door of nature closes
their maternal functions? They never
know what it is to have one whole
night’s rest. They are up nights
with babies. Is this freedom or liberty?
Hasn’t she a right to herself—hasn’t
she a duty to herself to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>when and under what conditions she
shall be a mother?</p>

<p class='c007'>We try to reduce our infant mortality
rate by our milk stations and
all of the other things going on today.
Thousands and thousands of
dollars are spent for this condition,
and to a certain degree some of it
is taken care of but it does not get
at the root. When we come to maternal
mortality we find also huge
funds that are spent in nurses going
into the homes of the poor, telling
the mother of eight children how
to have her ninth. (Laughter.)
Most of us know that that mother
wants to know how not to have her
tenth. That is the welcome assistance
that they can give that woman,
but that will be the last stone to
be turned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also our child labor—we make
laws in Washington against child
labor, hoping we will wipe that out
of existence. For 50 years they have
been trying to wipe child labor off
the books in the United States, but
they have not succeeded and they
will never succeed until they establish
birth control clinics in those
districts where these women are,
where they put in birth control clinics,
like they have in Holland—in
every industrial section in the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>States where women can come to
trained nurses and physicians and
get from them scientific information
whereby they may control birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we look upon all these things
just about in the same way. We try
to palliate most all of them. Take
one instance—our immigration laws.
The United States Government
makes the most rigid laws. It scans
over the vessels carefully to see that
no one should enter who is an idiot,
who is insane, and who is a pauper.
They see to it that anyone who enters
is not an idiot, is not insane and is
not a pauper. They make those
rigid laws and rules for those who
shall come in, but after you are once
on the inside, you can produce and reproduce
and repopulate the earth with
syphilitic and diseased and insane
people as far as the government is
concerned. This is the short-sighted
side of our whole life. We are very
generous and sympathetic but we are
oversentimental, and the time has
come to use our minds and to apply
our intelligence to life and to the conditions
of life as we find them today.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Mr. Russell has said some
things that are very interesting to
me. He tells us that we cannot have
pleasure without pain. It is a man
who is speaking. (Laughter and applause.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>It is very peculiar that Nature
only works on the one side of the
human family when it comes to that
law. She applies all the pain to the
woman. It is absurd—a perfectly absurd
argument in the face of rational
intelligence (applause) to talk about
marriage being for one purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I claim—and I differ with Mr.
Russell on that—I claim that the sex
relationship has distinctly two functions.
It has its love function and it
has its maternal and paternal function.
One is quite independent of
the other, and one is just as moral as
the other, and if it were not so, then
the laws of this country ought to divorce
the woman who is not able to
have children. Absolutely! And we
know it does not. We know that the
time the children are created that
there is not 1 percent of humanity
that is born or created with that
thought in mind. Very few people
think at the time of creation
that they are going to create. Most
of us are brought into the world by
accident and that is exactly what
birth control is going to change. That
is going to make humanity a
conscious and voluntary thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we talk of race suicide, it
would take almost a whole afternoon
to tell you how futile that argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>is. We know perfectly well, those of
us who have studied the question
that in those countries where birth
control knowledge has been at the disposal
of the people that, although the
birth rate has gone down, that the
death rate has also gone down. Consequently
the population has been accelerated
and there has been a better
population because it has been a
better and healthier population.
If Mr. Russell wants to
talk about the race and does not want
race suicide he had better come over
quickly to the ranks of birth control.
(Applause.)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Winter Russell<br /> <span class='large'>SECOND SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Russell: May I say at the
outset that I did not say we could
not have pleasure without pain. I
said we could not have pleasure without
paying for it and the man has to
pay. (Laughter.) I, too, am concerned
with the matter of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. I have
been trying to find out the truth
about that from the very first time
that I began to think, and that is
what I want to find out, and I devoutly
pray right now that if Mrs. Sanger
has got the truth that it will prevail,
but I want to know the truth
and I feel still that the truth is not
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am going to concern myself entirely
with refutation now. I am going
to speak a little more about the
positive side of this. I would say that
Mrs. Sanger has done quite a little for
me in pointing out that there are
these two groups she sees all of the
time—these families with large numbers
of children. I hope that I do not
miss sight of them entirely. I
may not know them directly or as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>intimately as Mrs. Sanger, but Mrs.
Russell has been in 1,500 of the homes
reported to be in dire straits and destitution.
I have been living with her
as her husband during the time that
she visited those homes. And I feel
that through her report I know something
of those homes as well. I see
the other homes of the small families,
but I am frank to say that I do think
in a far different line than Mrs.
Sanger. She says that the large family
is the family of poverty and of
misery; very often, though not always
nor in so large a measure as is
generally expected, is it the family of
poverty and by no means is it the
family of misery. I have seen the
misery beyond words in the small
family. I know that my mother considered—and
she had three children—that
her life was a long tragedy.
There was never a day that she waited
for food or clothes or a fine home,
but practically all of her talk was
like the story of a great tragedy.
My sister has a husband that has
now an income of $70,000 a year. She
has never known what it was to want
for food or clothes or a fine home, and
I heard her say not very long ago
that she had never known what happiness
on this earth is. Mrs. Sanger
sees poverty, she sees misery and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sees unwanted children. To be sure,
there are many thousands of these
homes where, sad to say, the children
are unwanted, but they have made
this devout prayer to God, I believe,
for children, and they have gotten
them. They have gotten what I believe
to be the greatest wealth and
treasure of the Kingdom of Heaven
that there is on the face of the
earth, and when they get that, they
have to pay for it. They have to pay
and take the responsibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>To my mind, these snickers and
giggles is one of the most tragic
things on the face of the earth. It
shows you haven’t got eyes that see.
You have neither ears that hear, and
you haven’t got the heart that feels.
(Chairman calls for more respectful
attention on the part of the audience.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, there are not as
many as she feels that are unwanted.
Many in these homes are glad that
they are numerous. And yet she says
these small families that she sees are
all wanted. I happen to know that
in those small families, as she sees
them, there is almost as large a percentage
of these one, two or three or
sometimes four kinds [sic]<a id='t32'></a> that are not
wanted. It has become an exception.
She has not become as scientific as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>she ought to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>She says she sees misery in large
families. I do not see so much happiness.
She says that she sees congestion
and infant mortality. A large
percentage of that was due to pure
ignorance. My father was a physician,
and in that town that I am going
to talk about—she says I know
nothing of the race suicide and I will
show you that I do—in this town of
small families, there was infant mortality.
My sister and I were on the
bed, at the door of death, for weeks
because we had a terrible disease. My
father was a physician. We know that
that disease has no terror whatever
for people who know how properly to
treat and feed children. There is a
difference in knowledge between that
day and this, and much of the infant
mortality is due to the lack of education.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she says in these days there
is not so much infant mortality. There
is a place—she finds here in the small
family, crime. I grant that there is
a lot of crime. They have filled a
large percentage of our prisons, but
I will have you remember that in those
homes that are small I believe that
there is a vastly greater number of
criminals, not only those who have
enough knowledge to keep within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>law but those who belong in the
penitentiaries, but they are keen
enough and they are shrewd enough
to keep without the law and escape it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lockwood Committee does not
prosecute these profiteers, these robbers
and pirates who belong in the
penitentiary, but just the same as
they think they can cheat nature by
having a small family—that greed
that makes them criminals that do
escape the law—I hold with Emerson
that they pay. They may not pay in
a penitentiary but they pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she says that here is where we
get our prostitution. Yes, again she
is right; a large number of the poor
and unfortunate girls who walk the
streets do come from these homes. For
every girl who walks the street in
that condition—I believe there are
100 who have a wedding certificate
and who live in a home—they are
worse than prostitutes (applause)—they
want somebody to be their meal
ticket. They want somebody that will
support them. They want respectability.
They want all the joy that
they haven’t got. You men have to
pay and you assume the responsibility.
Before these poor girls upon the
street I take off my hat and before
these I can’t express my detestation.
(Applause.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Then, just think of the logic of her
position. Oh, there are some beasts
in the marriage tie and they can’t be
self-controlled. What is the logic of
it all? Is she going to have the young
people filled up with this knowledge
and are people of her kind going to
have full sway over their lives—over
their life of sacrifice and consecration
to the welfare of humanity—over
those going through life single and
should they have compulsory marriage
because they don’t have
the joys of marriage? If she says
that they suffer the physicians
will tell you it is because
they don’t have children, and if they
do suffer, it is because they have to
pay that penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all of the sickly stuff I ever
heard of is this matter of tuberculosis
and heart disease and kidney
trouble. If a man has got a wife
that has tuberculosis and heart
disease and kidney trouble,
and he is such a beast that
he can’t control himself and can’t consecrate
himself to the sick wife, the
law should step in. Should we say
that we will surrender her to this
beast? Half of them do not know
the law of health and development,
and strength and energy comes from
that very law of self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Then this matter of child labor.
Why of course I would protect and
we are protecting them in other
States, and we are looking after it.
But it is better to have these children
born, terrible as it is, than not to
have any children at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they say that this matter of
venereal disease—Good Lord—apparently
she wants to give them a certificate
of an endless playground for
the rest of their lives. Feeble-minded,
of course the law should step in there
and devote a little intelligence to
prevent this crime from going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now as to this matter of health—in
the first place—we know that the
children are not being born. The statisticians
of every life insurance company
in the entire United States are
pointing out that the American stock
of today is dying out, that they are
not being born, and then this matter
of the children that are born. Let
us begin with them. Why, a boy or
girl that is born in a family of one
or two, in the first place, loses
about one-tenth of a natural life because
it has not the association with
children that it should have. I know
one child in a family that had quite
a number of friends and their selfish
and natural attitude is “none of this
one child stuff for me.” Those kids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>will grow up and become nothing—those
one or two children in a small
family are worthless. I will give you
the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>They talk about going to colleges
and universities. We are manacled
today by the fetishes of paper respectability.
I have seen a lot of
these patriots. My grandfather’s
mother had 13 children in a log cabin,
and I don’t think any of them died
young. They all lived to a good old
age. That old patriot—he never saw
the inside of a college, but he knew
more than half the graduates of Yale
and Harvard. He knew the facts of
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>This matter of the physical side of
it. You cannot divorce them. I don’t
care. I won’t discuss authorities. I
don’t care if Mrs. Sanger should
bring every medical authority there
is, for I can get as many as she can.
Take a case that comes up in court.
Some man says the defendant is very
insane. Another gets up—an expert—and
he says the defendant is not
insane at all. Everybody that she
can get to say that it is not harmful—I
can get someone to say that it is.
They go into the laboratory and prove
that the act is harmless, but they
can’t get into the mind and heart, and
the mind and heart have more to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>with the well being from the physical
point of view than anything you
can possibly conceive of. I was
brought up in New England and in
that section of the country every
housewife is a nervous wreck and
nearly everybody knows why.</p>

<p class='c007'>Audience: Why?</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Russell: Mrs. Sanger can tell
why. From the mental point of view,
I grant you here that it is difficult
to measure the kind, but this mental
development is an arrested development.
Do you know every father and
mother I believe are subjected to
this arrested development? That is
why we haven’t more energy and vibrating
health and strength in America
today. Why do we have this
apathy and sluggishness in American
life? It is because of these thousands
of arrested developments of these
people that want one or two children.</p>

<p class='c007'>These mothers think that they are
entitled to the whole world. Talk
about 2.75 percent beer. These
mothers are not even 10 percent mothers,
then of all the misrepresentations
and tears these mothers pour
over this one child—it makes me sick.
(Laughter.) The ghastly thing is
that they have but that one child. The
sad part of it is that we are not all
gifted with an imagination. Think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>what they are devoutly praying for—that
is the tragedy—just think
when they get that one life or two,
and then when they begin to plan and
contrive, and sacrifice themselves—then
if Fate or destiny cruelly takes
that one child—what greater tragedy
is there in this world?</p>

<p class='c007'>I have seen broken fathers and
mothers who have said that life is
dead when that only child or that
only daughter has been taken from
them. One of the saddest cases
I have ever seen in my life happened
a few days ago when a mother recently
buried her husband—and a few
years later buried her only son, and
then her daughter, who had risen to
the very pinnacle of fame here in the
city of New York, after one year of
existence was stricken down. A greater
tragedy you could not picture
than that. Consider this, that
for every one that is lost, how
many are there that they have not
brought forth into the world? They
don’t know what they have missed
and what they have lost. That to my
mind is the greatest tragedy of all,
the spiritual side of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now let me submit you a little
about the practical side of it. Mrs.
Sanger says that I am theoretical,
that I deal with the Bible. I do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>care whether or not the Bible has
said it. It wasn’t that that makes
me take this attitude. This is the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have birth control in America
today. The only thing is this—except
for two or three groups that to my
mind are the very heart and soul of
America and upon which it relies—we
have birth control in America. We
have birth control and Mrs. Sanger
and the rest of her kind would talk
to the fresh, wholesome people that
are coming over who are the hope
of America—she would come to them
and not wait as we do make them
wait in order to become citizens. We
say “you cannot be citizens until you
have a few years.” She would say,
“We will hand you this purely American
doctrine of birth control and you
can have that right off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I have an opportunity of seeing
this through the years. I am going to
give you a picture of the block in
which I was born and brought up,
that I have watched for 30 years.
Thirty years ago I began to watch
the block. There were 17 families,
34 people at the start; 34 people who
were successful, they believe, in this
little town of 3,500 people. It had
a fine school, a State Normal School—one
of the foremost in the State. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>had a Boys’ School known nationally,
if not internationally, and they were
34 people in 17 homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>All were successful and owned
their own homes with well-kept lawns
and they were thoroughly American.
They believed that they were well educated
people and that they were successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, take them house by house.
The first family was a merchant.
They had one child, a girl, and “Oh,
what a girl was Mary.” She was a
singer. There, Mrs. Sanger says,
Nature was kind. She was a singer
and she yodeled and warbled over the
country and then her parents
thought that Mary was going to be
a great singer. No, she did not become
one. She married the station
agent. The station agent did not
find that there was much rhythm in
music in the home as there was in
Mary’s voice and he went out, and
finally he stayed out altogether. He
walked in front of the locomotive and
that was the finish of him. Mary
lives today in a little boarding house.
That family is extinct. Mary is still
living on. That family is gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next house, there was a man
who was a kind of good-for-nothing
fellow. I suppose the town said he
came from far away and that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a boomer, but he had a wondrous
wife. This wife wasn’t educated, but
she had the most phenomenal energy.
She could wash 23 hours a day and
she did. They had three children and
she, as Mrs. Sanger has said, she
wanted them to be brought up decent.
The boy was sent to Harvard, by this
23 hours a day wash. It was a fine
home. The boy went to Harvard and
became a good-for-nothing, and went
out West.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was another daughter married.
She had a son, too, who died.
She married a man in Vermont. They
never had children and never will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third daughter married. She
was a painter. She painted canvasses.
The station agent after an
alarming career of drunkenness, died.
He was respectable. He was a federal
official, but he died. And she will
never have children.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one child from that family.
In the next house was the superintendent
of the state Normal College;
two children, one boy, who after a
career, he married. The other is an
old maid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next house was a physician. His
first wife went insane. He had a
beastly temper. I don’t know whether
it was birth control that did it. There
was one daughter. She had several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>marriages but no children. Then she
married again. That second wife
went to the insane asylum. One child
died before it was of marriageable
age.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next house was a man who
had two children, and they never had
grandchildren. In the next house was
a veteran of the Civil War who spent
most of his pension money on drink.
He had two sons, one of whom was
married and his wife died in familiar
circumstances. I suppose she was
not quite well informed. There was
one child. The other boy from that
family—he is looked upon as uncommon
and vulgar because he has four
children. Then this next house, there
was a man who had several farms.
They had three children. One of
them was an old maid. The second
girl married after several years. She
died. There is one child from the
third. In that next house was one of
my uncles. He died, too, leaving two
children, but they never lived and
there is no grandchildren from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crossing on the other side of the
street, another physician. They had
a son who went to college. He has become
a druggist in Vermont, married
20 years and no children.</p>

<p class='c007'>That family is extinct. In the next
house was another physician. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>died at the age of 45. His wife had
no children. His wife was the champion
bon-bon eater. In the next house
there was a boy and a girl. She married
a drunkard. He was a dentist.
No children. The brother is out West,
and I believe there are two children
there. In the next house, there was a
son and daughter. The daughter
married the cashier of the savings
bank. No children; 25 years married.
The son did not learn birth control
quick enough. They had a child before
they were married. (Laughter.)
His mother took him and sent him
out on a farm and she taught him,
and they only have had one since.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came my father’s house. I
have one sister and one brother.
My sister has three children and my
brother four, and I have four. (Applause.)
There are eleven grandchildren.
Within the next house, there
is a merchant living with his wife and
they both tended store. They wanted
to be so decent and accumulate a lot
of property. They became the crankiest
individuals and when he died, his
wife said he was the handsomest
looking corpse she had ever seen. It
is extinct. No children whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another that lived in that
house, and they had one child. Out of
those 17 families, nine are extinct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Nine are dead and gone. They have
passed away. Is that race suicide?
Out of eight who remain, out of the
34 people, out of these eight families,
there are 26 grandchildren. My father’s
family produced 12 of the 26. Out
of 33 of the families, there are 14
grandchildren if you except mine. I
think I am an exception. There is
race suicide. Don’t tell me that that
is one exceptional block. I can duplicate
that block on every street in
that town except one blessed community,
Little Canada. They were not
Americans. They were vulgar. They
were poor. They want big families,
but from these poor families in Little
Canada, there have come the
French Canadians. From them come
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, and
they are inheriting the town. There
is race suicide.</p>

<p class='c007'>I can duplicate that block in practically
every American city in this
country. I can duplicate that block
in every apartment house on the west
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>America is dying today—the America
that we know. I wish that it were
not. I wish that it could get a cleaner
and better ideal, but it hasn’t got
it. That is the tragedy of it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, that is what we have got to
consider, whether we are going to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>that or not. I have no worry what
ever and life has no worry. It does
not matter what you prove, the inexorable
law goes on. “Those who do
shall inherit the earth. They shall
have life unto the end and the others
shall be extinct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I come from college—Harvard. I
believe that the average production
of college graduates in America is
three-quarters of a life. That is statistically
and literally true. (Applause)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Margaret Sanger<br /> <span class='large'>SECOND SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Sanger: There is no doubt
there are many ways of race suicide
but Mr. Russell has not proven
to me yet that birth control is causing
it. He has shown us—given us
the number of inhabitants in a block
which, according to his ideas, are dying
out. Those who have had no
children—there is no reason to claim
or to know just what is the cause of
those people not having children.
Many barren women today might be
desirous of having children, and they
go through serious operations in order
to have children, and because
sometimes of an infection given
to her by her husband, she is unable
to bear children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, for every block that
Mr. Russell can produce in New York
City, where they are controlling their
numbers and where they are not having
the numbers sufficient to his satisfaction
I can show you an equal
number who are overdoing themselves.
(Applause.) I can give him one
block in New York City where there
are 10,000 people, and but one airshaft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>between them. They are living
huddled together practically like animals
and he will ask these people
still to produce numbers to a greater
extent than they have.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we talk about race suicide it
seems to me that there are other
things that one must consider. Birth
control will improve the quality of the
race, and unless we do improve the
quality of the race, it is better that
we do have race suicide. (Applause.)
Certainly all of us who
have lived within the past five years
and have seen what has gone on in
the world—we have seen the destruction
of life—we have seen it so mercilessly
taken—certainly, there are
other ways that race suicide is being
put out upon the world other
than birth control. War certainly
has done something to wipe out the
inhabitants of the earth. And if you
go to Europe where I have been the
last six months or so and see the condition
of misery and unhappiness
that is going on there, particularly in
Central Europe, you would say that
death would be a blessing to these
people, instead of the hand of peace
that has come to them. When I saw
more than 15,000 little children in
Germany that were born since the
war, friends, brought into being in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the most terrible conditions that any
country could be in—those children
were brought to birth because they,
too, did not believe in birth control.
They believe in numbers, in expansion,
in more and more children, and today,
those hundreds and hundreds of children
have no backbone. They are almost
unable to hold up their heads.
They will be absolutely useless for
another generation. Are these the
kind of children we want to bring into
the world? Don’t we want quality
instead of quantity?</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to me it is time we used
our intelligence and stopped the ranting
phrases that we have been hearing
so many of today. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Again I say, Mr. Russell tells us
that he was quite sick when he heard
me tell about women who had tuberculosis
and heart disease and other
ailments, and should have been prevented
from becoming pregnant. He
said the man who did not have self-control
was not worth much. I wonder
if Mr. Russell knows—he is a
lawyer, and I wonder if he knows
what the laws of this state are as far
as you men are concerned. The Bible
states “Wives, submit yourselves unto
your husbands.” It is one of the
things put into our laws, and the
woman who does not submit to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>husband—he does not have to support
her. I wonder if Mr. Russell
knows that. I have myself had cases
where women have come to me and
said: “What shall I do? I have left
this man. I can’t have more children.”
And when she comes to court
the judge has said: “Are you willing
to live with this man or not?” And
she said: “I can’t have more children.
I don’t want more children.” And the
judge said: “You must adjust this
matter for yourselves.” The man did
not have to support her unless she
submitted her body to him. That is
the condition today.</p>

<p class='c007'>We talk about self-control. I think
none of us who look on the world
know there is self-control. No one
delves in self-control. That is one of
the finest human instincts there is.
When you see hungry people going
around with plenty of food in front
of them, I think there is self-control
in the world. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c007'>And don’t forget that this self-control—and
I would like to ask anyone
to contradict it that a man and
woman may be ever so self-controlled
and if they are married and live
in marriage relationship—that it only
means one embrace or one union to
have a baby every year. The most
self-controlled man and woman in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>world can still have a family that
that man can’t take care of. That is
something to remember.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, if we mean, and
if Mr. Russell would only talk so that
we can understand him—plainly—I
have to tell you what he means as a
matter of fact. If Mr. Russell means
that this relationship between man
and woman should only be for procreation,
then that is another matter.
I wish he would say so. If it means
you are going to have two children,
then only two times in your life you
should have union—that’s another
question. But our marriage laws are
not based on that law. And it would
have to be a strict understanding before
a woman married, before that
union or that companionship or relationship
could take place. I have no
objection whatsoever to any individuals
who wish to live that way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I am speaking for the millions
of women who are crushed with over
child-bearing, whose lives are broken
and who have become drudges in the
family today. I am speaking for
mothers and the individual here, and
there does not concern me in the
least. They may be an exception, but
I know there are millions and millions
of women who are married, who
are just as self-controlled as anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Mr. Russell can show us, who are
living in terror of pregnancy, but they
have men who are just as good to
them. Men are not all beasts. These
people give you an idea that men are
a lustful, beastly creature, looking
to violate some woman’s virtue. I
wonder why a man does not stand up
against that. They never do. It
takes a woman to stand up for them.
I know that most of the women that
I have lived with—their husbands
are men who are just as considerate
and decent as anyone you can find.
They are trapped in ignorance. That
is what is the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our whole sexual education has
been at fault. We have been kept in
blinders. We have been taught that
this relationship is a vital, terrible
thing—put it out of your hearts. However
a marriage certificate is placed
in your hands and Presto! everything
is supposed to be made beautiful.
(Applause and laughter.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Our married life and happiness depends
upon an attitude and an ideal
attitude towards our relation, and we
are not going to get it by blindness
and by ignorance. We are going to
get it by adjusting our own interests
and our own intelligence to life as it
is today, and I claim that any man
living on the average workingman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>wage today is not able to support
some two or three children decently.
There may be exceptions to that, but
we have more than—I think it is something
like 40,000 or 50,000 people in
this country who are living and dependent
upon public charity, and every
time a man and woman does not
have the conscious responsibility toward
the children that they are going
to bring into being, and have them
according to Nature, as Mr. Russell
would say, without regard to their
protection, to preparing for their
coming—that just as sure as we do
that—the man’s wage to do is unable
to keep up with his reproductive
power. That has been the history of
labor all the way down, and the man
and woman who brings to birth children
that they can’t take care of, it
means you are going to pass that burden
and the responsibility upon some
one else. We have today in China
this terrible poverty that is going on
there. Thirty millions of people in
China are starving to death. The
Chinese have always lived according
to Mr. Russell’s theory, and they are
appealing now to low birth rate countries,
to those who have as a nation
used birth control; they are appealing
to them now to save some other millions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of others in China and we have
to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The responsibility always comes
back upon those who have protected
themselves, those who have lived within
their own means, and according to
their own intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am not going to take up all the
time I have been allotted because I
am quite through. I want to say in
the first place birth control joins the
fight against the transmission of venereal
disease to the next generation.
Birth control is the pivot around
which every movement must swing
making for race betterment. Birth
control does not act as a substitute
for any social scheme or other ideal
system. But it must be the base and
serve them as a foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Birth control will free the mother
from the trap of pregnancy. It will
save the child from that procession
of coffins, as well as from the toil of
mill and factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Birth control will make parenthood
a voluntary function instead of an
accident as it is today. When motherhood
and childhood is free, we then
can go hand in hand with the emancipation
of the human race. (Applause.)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Winter Russell<br /> <span class='large'>THIRD SPEECH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Russell: May I say that if
Mrs. Sanger does not know what the
cause of no children in Farmington
was, I do. Everybody in that town
knew. It was because they had made
up their minds that they were not
going to do that and they did not
have them.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is one of the great troubles
with this volunteer parenthood—it is
that there are so very few volunteers.
Mrs. Sanger and I agree upon this
matter of education. She would not say
to those who are trying to find the
ready path to health—those who are
afflicted with tuberculosis and venereal
disease—that they can reach this
road to health by self control. She
says that we will educate you and the
feeble-minded about the most delicate,
intricate complications, and disseminate
information and literature that
we have on the human body. She
thinks she can take the millions of
people and, as a matter of cold fact,
introduce this knowledge. A large
percentage of these millions of abortions
are due to the fact that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>thought they knew all about it and
they didn’t. And Mrs. Sanger has
pointed out that here still is a lot of
laboratory experiments and research
work that has got to be done before
they will be absolutely, scientifically
sure that they will know just exactly
what they are doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would have them educated, and I
would have Mrs. Sanger and all the
rest of them change their views in
this connection because of education.
I agree with her absolutely with this.
We are handing a marriage certificate
to those who are not prepared
to have it. We make a man who is
going to run a steam engine or an
automobile or prepare teeth—he has
to have a license. We ought to know
about this matter of rearing children.
We ought to have education but it
ought to be the education that will
give us the key to self-control and
teach us how to take care of the
children after they have come.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then this matter of the difficulty
of self-control. If these people
that have the one or two or three
children would take them with joy
and thanksgiving and devote themselves
to the higher mental and spiritual
development that ought to come
with them, and would have come if
they had been properly educated, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>matter of self-control would be a very
simple matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, this matter of quality. We are
misled on this matter of quality—this
matter of accomplishments. I don’t
know how I can possibly impress this
any better than this. I believe that a
woman who comes into Ellis Island
and can neither read nor write, and
has seven to eight children, is worth
more to the United States of America
than a graduate of Vassar University.
I will go further. I say this
that if I had not been blessed with a
wife and mother such as Mrs. Russell
is, that I would choose for a wife today—I
would rather have a girl that
cooks and can’t read nor write, who
loves children, than some of these
graduates with accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have four sons, and I hope and I
pray that instead of getting as a wife
an educated rag and a bone and a
hank of hair with accomplishments,
that they will get some of these women
that want and love a big family of
children. I believe that their life
will be richer, nobler, and fuller. I
have a daughter. I hope and devoutly
pray that instead of any person
who is so utterly absorbed in
this volunteer practice and they think
that after some years that they will
have one or two children—I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>not say a common working man—I
would say a divine working man—I
would rather she have one of those
and have a big family of children,
rather than she should have one of
the other kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Canada with its families has
given a better quality of children to
that town and country than any other
place. They call for statistics of volunteer
countries. They don’t realize
it that there are great segments of
humanity that have it as a fundamental
part of their life—this matter
of sacred relations. When you come
to think that there is not one single
phase in life, one single place that you
can be frivolous with this sacred function,
that it does not rebound and
makes you repay and takes its penalty—you
pay the penalty. They have
tried to take the sweet without the
responsibility. They have thought
that they could scheme with this sacred
thing and strike a balance book
with nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact in China, I was
reading the other night, two or
three of the great political economists,
they say there is not a single
case in the history of the world where
there has been starving because of
the number of people. The future of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the race belongs to those that have
the numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they say it is due to the war
and the explosive populations. It is
just ourselves, Germany, France
and Italy, who have been practising
this thing for years, the big material
nations of the world, that are
to blame. Those nations that are true
to life are going to inherit the earth.
It is inexorable in the way in which
it works out.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I look at America today, I see
it in the grip of a foul monster. It
was as though we have been gassed. I
consider these teachings as mental
and spiritual dope. Morphine and heroin
don’t compare with the way in
which we are duped today. It speaks
in all of our literature and customs.
When you see a woman in a pregnant
condition today, you see smirks
and snubs as though it was a misfortune
to that poor woman. We are
today in the grip of a foul monster.
It speaks in our literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the intellectual life of America
today. Greenwich Village thinks
it is intellectual. It is the intellectual
sewage disposal plant of America
today, and it is not very scientific.
It is a fact. Fifth Avenue and the
west side where I live—it is the social
garbage dumping grounds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>United States of America. All these
people that think that they have to
be decent and have the freedom and
liberty—freedom to be foul, freedom
to be disgusting—if there is anything
that annoys me and my nerves is this
puking pus that is called love poured
forth over the poodle dog by some
volunteer married person today.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, a large family
is the hope of the world. It is the
greatest disciplinary force that there
is in life. There is nothing that so
develops the mind and soul of man
and the woman as bringing up a great
family of children. These disciplinary
forces we are losing today and
that is because we are following the
easiest way. We are taking the
course of the least resistance. You
are trying to get the honey and escape
the thorns, and it can’t be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oh, these people. If Mrs. Sanger
were true in this matter—then why
is it that the great mass of people—the
down and outers, are single men,
and a good many of them, single
women? It is because they haven’t
control to get the skill that is necessary
and there is always that condition.
We find that by self-control
one can lead a life of singleness.
We find that self-control gives
them influence and power.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>School teachers, priests and nuns—those
people that have a tremendous
influence, practice self-control—they
think they can obtain the pleasure
without paying for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, the individual is really unimportant.
If you look at life itself
and what you are trying to do, it is
the race that is going to produce. It
is the race of the past that has made
it possible for us to be here today.
And only as we measure up to this
tremendous responsibility does the
race of tomorrow depend. I cannot
give you all that I would like to give
you—a vision. But I believe that in
these great unborn numbers is really—there
is the real resources of America.
Why, we have resources ample.
We could all move into Texas
and it would not be as crowded as
Belgium was before the war began.
This matter of food and clothes—we
haven’t begun to touch the resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>About that little town in Maine,
rotten to the core with its birth control,
there are hundreds of depleted
farms that used to support families
of ten and twelve children, and do
that well, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is where the future lies in the great
unborn, in the heart, and in the
soul. The psychologists say we use but
10 percent of the brains we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and we are using a small percentage
of the spiritual and moral resources
we have, and we can do it if we live
up to this responsibility that we
ought to incur.</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe that in every mind and
heart there is faith and love that
would make life glorious and glad indeed,
and I wish I could give you
the vision of that. I have sought for
ambition, fame, power, and I would
like to write a great song, but I know
I could never begin to express the music
and joy of a great home, of a fine
pure home.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would like to paint a great picture,
but I know I could never begin
to depict the color and composition
that there is in a little daughter or
son’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would like to have a great piece
of sculpture as my work, but I know
that I could never begin to express
the beauty and form of a little loving
child in a home.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would like to write a great novel
but I know I could not for one moment
begin to give the comedy and
the tragedy, the romance, and the
thrill that there is in the home group
of little children.</p>

<p class='c007'>And I would like to write a great
play, but I know that I could not begin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to give the drama, the comedy and
the tragedy that there is in bringing
up a little family.</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe that the great mass of so-called
Americans are today voluntarily
but blindly shutting the unborn
out from the Heavens to which I
hope we will all ultimately reach. I
thank you for your courtesy and consideration.
(Applause.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gould: May I announce that
the real and practical decision of this
debate will be rendered by the New
York State Legislature when they
take up the problem of whether or not
birth control should be made public
knowledge? I thank you.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
